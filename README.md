## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

- **Vercel**: [https://vercel.com/belals-projects-4752af6b/omaya](https://vercel.com/belals-projects-4752af6b/omaya)
- **GitHub Pages**: [https://alkhudarigroupuae.github.io/Omaya-Class/](https://alkhudarigroupuae.github.io/Omaya-Class/)

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. Every push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a deployment
2. The workflow builds the Next.js app as a static site
3. The built files are deployed to GitHub Pages
4. You can also manually trigger deployments from the Actions tab

To enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. The site will be automatically deployed on the next push to `main`
